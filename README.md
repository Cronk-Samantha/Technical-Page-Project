# Technical-Page-Project

This CSS technical page is one of the projects available at freecodecamp's website. The project was to build a technical documentation page (of your choosing) with at least 5 sections, a navigation bar with links to each section, and at least 5 code tags. I added all of the required elements but everything else was my design/content. I chose to do CSS so I could have a quick reference page for things I find myself forgetting and hopefully will keep adding to it whenever I think of something. This was a great project for setting up what looks like a fairly simple layout but has a lot going on with CSS. Happy Coding :)
