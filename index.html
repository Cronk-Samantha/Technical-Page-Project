            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome! One of the required projects in freeCodeCamp's responsive web design certification course is to make
                a technical page similar to the one you see before you. I chose to dedicate a page to CSS to serve as a quick reference for me in future projects.
            <br>CSS, in my opinion, is the easiest of the front-end languages to learn. However (if you are anything like me) you will find yourself getting a headache from everything there is to memorize. 
            The amount of styles, values, even colors! I find myself constantly having to look up properties again to make sure I am using the acceptable values and using it in the right way. 
            <br>Enter - this technical page. Whether your a complete beginner to the world of web development or your a seasoned devloper, I hope you find this page useful for any of your coding needs.</p>

            <h2>Let's Talk CSS</h2>
            <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and is a style sheet language we use to - you guessed it - style our webpages. 
                We are describing to the browser which HTML elements we want styled and how we want them styled. We can also use CSS to format webpages that re-size automatically depending on the device it's being viewed on!
            </p>
            <p>A fundamental concept for anyone looking to get into web development:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>HTML is <em>what</em> we put on the website (titles, paragraphs, images, videos, links, etc..)</li>
                <li>CSS is <em>how</em> we style the stuff on the webpage (text size, background-color, text color, spacing, borders..)</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Eventually, you then add JavaScript to add animation and make the webpage more interactive but that's getting ahead of myself... </p>
